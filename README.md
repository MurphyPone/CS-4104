# CS-4104
Some implementations of the algorithms discussed and assigned in CS-4104.  Notes, problem sets, and formal solutions can be found [here](https://www.murphyandhislaw.com/blog/algorithm-notes).

## Graphs

A simple graph implementation along with the expected search algorithms as well as a bonus `operation_save_will_beyers` 

## Scheduling Problems

>  Let’s consider a long, quiet country road with houses scattered very sparsely along it.
> (We can picture the road as a long line segment, with an eastern endpoint and a western endpoint.)
> Further, let’s suppose that despite the bucolic setting, the residents of all these houses are avid cell
> phone users. You want to place cell phone base stations at certain points along the road, so that every house is within four miles of one of the base stations.
> Give an efficient algorithm that achieves this goal, using as few base stations as possible. Just in case the problem statement is not completely clear, you can assume that the road is the x-axis, that each house lies directly on the road, and that the position of each house can be specified by its x-coordinate 

## Misc

> Devise a sublinear algorithm to stress-test jars' strength using the minimal amount of jars possible.
